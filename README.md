# Hope4Hops

Ever have that problem when a brewery released their greatest brew and can't
seem to get your hands on it? We have too! Which is why we have developed
Hope4Hops!  At the Hope4Hops team, we want to use location services to find
you and that brew you've been searching for with our easy to use interface!

If you want to search for a specific beer, input beer name in the **Search Beer** search bar.

If you want to search by brewery, input brewery name in the **Search Brewery** search bar.

To narrow down the amount of liquor stores near you use the **Search Proximity** drop down

With the following input values, we will return a selection of liquor stores that contain the product you are searching for on the map.

**Happy Hunting!**

**Drink Responsibly!**

**Cheers Friends!**
